## Project Overview

MSweep is a DIY minesweeper robot designed and built by Team Fighting Bombs, Ordnance, and Mines with Breakthroughs in Science at Columbia University. This project was developed as part of the Fall '23 Hacking For Defense class with the goal of creating an efficient and cost-effective solution for clearing antipersonnel mines in contested environments. The project files and design are available here and open-source for anyone to pull and modify to their needs!

Key features of MSweep include:
- Twin-engine, three-wheeled design for stability and maneuverability
- Dimensions: 24" wide x 24" long
- Capable of clearing a 24" wide path
- Powered by dual C6374 170KV brushless motors
- Maximum speed of 5 miles per hour
- Designed for easy reproduction and replacement of parts

## Design Process

### Initial Concept

The initial design concept for MSweep was inspired by the idea of a 3-wheeled mine detonating electric skateboard. This concept aimed to create a simple, cost-effective, and easily reproducible robot capable of clearing antipersonnel mines in various terrains.

## Manufacturing Process

Our manufacturing process involved a combination of techniques:

1. **3D Printing:**
   - Used for rapid prototyping of components
   - Materials: Thermoplastic PLA (polylactic acid)
   - Advantages: Quick iterations, complex geometries
   - Challenges: Variability in print quality, limited durability

2. **CNC Machining:**
   - Planned for final production of drivetrain components
   - Advantages: Increased durability, precision

3. **Metal Base:**
   - Material: Mild steel
   - Chosen for its toughness, affordability, and availability

Assembly process included:
- Wooden prototype base with cut-outs and indentations
- 3D printed components mounted with M2 screws
- Custom electrical connections and wiring

## Electrical Design

The electrical system of MSweep includes:
- Arduino Uno as the central processor
- Dual ESCs (Electronic Speed Controllers) with VESC software
- RC receiver for wireless control
- CAN Bus protocol for motor synchronization
- Custom Y-splitter cables and connections

## Testing Plan

Our testing plan focuses on three main objectives:
1. Maneuverability and operability on various terrains
2. Effectiveness at detonating mines and identifying weak points
3. Endurance and battery life

Planned tests include:
- Terrain testing (pavement, grass, sand, inclines)
- Detonation testing (in coordination with local authorities)
- Battery life and range testing

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for future development include:
- Refinement of blast-resistant components
- Integration of additional sensors for autonomous operation
- Exploration of alternative materials for weight reduction
- Enhancement of control systems for improved maneuverability
